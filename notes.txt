The IBM Research Laboratory is located just 40 minutes away from ETH Zurich. This creates a fantastic opportunity for highly motivated ETH Students to join our unique research-corporate environment for a Master Thesis, Semester Project or Internship.

Composable Data Management Systems are a relatively new research area which can be seen as an evolution of today’s data lakehouse architecture where storage and data have been decoupled thanks to open data formats. We are now moving towards on standardizing the other components of a data management system to make workloads more portable and helping users to find the best workload-engine-match under cost-performance constraints. One key open-source project in this area is Substrait which defines an open serialization format for query plans which is already supported by several engines. To achieve this portability of workloads we are seeing the following challenges that we would like to address:

cross-engine query optimization considering the different Substrait capabilities supported by an engine
cross-engine query optimization using learned performance models of engines to assign queries to engines
framework for defining portable user defined functions that can be securely executed within any engine
extensions of the Substrait specification to cover non-relational operations that are common in defining machine learning/AI data pipelines

As part of our team, you will collaborate with experienced Research Scientists and AI Software Engineers that will lead and help you to successfully complete the challenges of the proposed task. The technology created in our team is powering IBM mainstream products, in particular watsonx.data.

Minimum qualifications

Bachelor’s degree in computer science or machine learning, including equivalent practical experience
Experience with databases / data management systems, SQL, relational algebra, query plans
Team player, self-motivated with a passion for technology and innovation

Preferred qualifications

Experience with database optimization, machine learning/AI
3+ years of proved programming experience in Python or Java
Experience with Substrait, Apache Calcite, Apache Arrow, WASM
Independent worker with the ability to effectively operate with flexibility in a fast-paced, constantly evolving team environment

Master Thesis, Internship

Internship or Master Thesis on How to storage 101: Configuration Space exploration of Modern Linux Storage stacks

Ref. 2024_023

Project description

Modern storage stacks on NVMe are complex and have numerous configuration options that an application can configure. Not only that, to deliver high performance in a reliable and predictable manner, one must understand the intricate interaction between storage hardware, CPU, operating system, memory management, scheduler, and complex hardware and software internals. Storage stacks such as SPDK take many of such roles under their control, skipping the operating system completely. However, modern emerging APIs such as io_uring selectively offer to keep the kernel (thus, maintaining all the benefits of using it - caching, file system, sharing) and still let applications configure many of such performance knobs.

The goal of this work is to build a performance reasoning framework to explore the configurations space of modern storage stacks: specifically SPDK and io_uring. In this context, the key research questions that we want to answer are:

Is SPDK style user-space storage stack still the best way to build modern high-performance storage applications? In this context, we would like to benchmark, quantify and explain the performance gap between io_uring and SPDK.
Are there design guidelines in which high-performance storage should be integrated in applications. Here we would like to understand how async I/O is integrated and used in state-of-the-practice applications (Databases, key-value store, graph storage, machine learning frameworks).
Given a default starting configuration of a machine, can we develop a configuration optimization methodology and implement it to automatically guide the configuration space optimization. Here a system model is needed to be built that can reason about the expected performance, and help us diagnose root cause in case of performance anomalies.

Qualifications:

Enrolled or in possession of a Master's degree in computer science with a keen interest in data storage research, cloud computing and performance engineering.
Excellent coding skills: Familiarity with Linux environments and software development tools (git/GitHub, IDEs, gcc, gdb, QEMU, virtual machine and containers etc.).
High amount of creativity and outstanding problem-solving ability.

Preferred Qualifications:

Experience with systems programming and internals (kernel, memory management, hardware, CPU)
Experience with data storage and NVMe storage internals and specification
Experience in machine learning or cloud
Experience with performance engineering tools (perf, fio, ebpf)
Excellent oral and written English with good presentation skills.
Strong interpersonal skills and excellent written and verbal communication.

Diversity

IBM is committed to diversity 
 at the workplace. With us you will find an open, multicultural environment. Excellent flexible working arrangements enable all genders to strike the desired balance between their professional development and their personal lives.

Master Thesis, Internship

Internship or Master Thesis on NVMe Computational Storage: Revising the Computational Offloading

Ref. 2024_021

Project description

Since NVMe 2.1 (Aug 2024), the Computational Command Set (CCS) specification has been ratified in the NVMe 2.1 specification. With that now there is a push for a standardized approach towards program offloading in NVMe devices. However with its new API and the nature of offload type - there is uncertainty regarding what programs, workflows can benefit from such offloading capability.We are interested in the following research questions:

Are there specific domains of applications that have particular affinity towards computational offloading as offered by the NVMe CCS?
In recent years there has been a renewed interest in building out-of-core graph processing systems. Can out-of-core graph processing systems benefit from the NVMe CCS specification?
Design and implement a simulator and performance reasoning model for graph offloading: The goal is to identify various opportunities on how we can develop SSDs, storage stacks, and graph processing frameworks to deliver end-to-end performance gains. Hence, we would like to answer “what-if” questions like: What if SSD reads were 10x faster? What is the impact of graph operator offloading to SSD?

Qualifications:

Enrolled or in possession of a Master's degree in computer science with a keen interest in data storage research, cloud computing and performance engineering.
Excellent coding skills: Familiarity with Linux environments and software development tools (git/GitHub, IDEs, gcc, gdb, QEMU, virtual machine and containers etc.).
High creativity and outstanding problem-solving ability.

Preferred Qualifications:

Experience with systems programming and internals (kernel, memory management, hardware, CPU)
Experience with data storage and NVMe storage internals and specification
Experience in machine learning or cloud
Experience with performance engineering tools (perf, fio, ebpf)
Excellent oral and written English with good presentation skills.
Strong interpersonal skills and excellent written and verbal communication.

Diversity

IBM is committed to diversity 
 at the workplace. With us you will find an open, multicultural environment. Excellent flexible working arrangements enable all genders to strike the desired balance between their professional development and their personal lives.

Arbeitsort:Zurich

Master Thesis, Internship

Internship or Master Thesis in graph theory and in developing libraries to enable powerful functional and executable graphs

Ref. 2024_020

Project description

A master’s student or intern position is available for a candidate interested in graph theory and in developing libraries to enable powerful functional and executable graphs. Graphs have a wide range of properties such as direction, cyclicity, edge weight, etc. which make them applicable to a wide range of domains including computer science, linguistics, chemistry, biology, etc. Many works propose powerful new algorithms for operating on graphs; however, such works usually consider their novelties in isolation, not tied to a pre-existing graph library.

In the IBM Analog AI team, we are developing architectures and methods for implementing Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) on Analog In-Memory Computing (AIMC) accelerators. AIMC platforms utilize non-volatile in-memory computing to perform extremely low energy and latency DNN inference. While promising for enabling low-power DNN execution from the cloud down to the edge, these highly heterogeneous accelerators present novel challenges in efficiently mapping the DNN onto the hardware. Our team is developing the tools necessary to accomplish these tasks, with part of this work developing a powerful functional graph library.

As part of our team, you will collaborate closely with researchers on identifying, developing, and integrating graph algorithms into our existing research efforts on AIMC Architectures. The work will involve developing the extensions for publication in a top-tier conference. The duration of the internship is at a minimum of 4 months and can be conducted either as a Master's thesis or as an internship.

Minimum Qualifications:

Bachelor’s degree in computer science or machine learning, including equivalent practical experience
Outstanding C++ programming skills, Python also beneficial
Independent learning/working abilities
Strong work ethic

Preferred Qualifications:

Previous work with graphs, Boost Library
Previously published / contributed to work in conference or journal venue

Diversity

IBM is committed to diversity 
 at the workplace. With us you will find an open, multicultural environment. Excellent flexible working arrangements enable all genders to strike the desired balance between their professional development and their personal lives.

The Space Weather group of the Astronomical Institute of the University of Bern (AIUB) is inviting applications for a PhD student to work on observational solar physics and data analysis.
The University of Bern hosts many domains of astronomy, from solar physics, to exoplanets, and satellite observations. The successful candidate will work in the space weather group, which focuses on understanding solar flares with machine learning, building astronomical instrumentation, and on researching the physics of the Sun. This position is part of a SERI-funded ERC CoG grant.

Flares are eruptions on the Sun, which can influence the Earth by causing power outages, changes of satellite orbits, aurora, and enhanced radiation. However, solar flares can neither be reliably predicted, nor is their physics fully understood. The goal of this PhD project is to carry out research in observational solar physics, particularly by leading observations at the Swedish Solar Telescope (SST) to obtain new data of solar flares and to analyze these data to determine the structure of the solar atmosphere during flares.

The PhD student will learn about space weather, solar observations, solar data reduction, data analysis, radiative transfer, and modeling to interpret the solar atmosphere. The length of a PhD is typically 3-4 years. Support for conferences and collaborations is available.




Requirements

• We are looking for highly motivated candidates with (or obtaining soon) a MSc in physics, astronomy, or a related topic.
• A strong interest in experimental work is desired, particularly in operating a telescope, analyzing astronomical data, and in programming.
• A background in programming in Python or IDL is desired.
• At least a basic knowledge of astronomy is required and knowledge of astronomical data analysis is beneficial.
• Strong verbal and written communication skills in English.
• Strong analytical abilities and problem solving/troubleshooting skills.
• Teamplayer who likes to work with other group members and students.


Appointment

Starting in spring 2025, open until filled. Funding for a maximum of 4 years.


Application




Salary and Contract

Based on the regulations of the University of Bern, starting at 47k CHF per year.
Please contact Prof. Dr. Lucia Kleint (email: E-Mail schreiben)


An equal opportunity environment is important to us, and we welcome applicants from groups that are traditionally underrepresented in physics and astronomy. We will be particularly pleased to receive applications from women for the advertised position.

Pensum:100%
Vertrag:Festanstellung
Arbeitsort:Dübendorf
Eawag, the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology, is an internationally networked aquatic research institute within the ETH Domain (Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology). Eawag conducts research, education and expert consulting to achieve the dual goals of meeting direct human needs for water and maintaining the function and integrity of aquatic ecosystems.


PostDoc in Plankton Ecology (2 years)


The Phytoplankton Ecology Group 
  at the Department of Aquatic Ecology 
 of Eawag is looking for a


The position is ideal for a junior postdoc and it is fully funded for two years (2025 and 2026) with the possibility (pending additional funds) to be extended for a third year (2027). The position is affiliated to the group of Dr Francesco Pomati 
 . 


The postdoc will help support and coordinate the research group activities and exploit the rich and multidimensional plankton datasets we have collected using automated monitoring ( www.aquascope.ch 
 ). Data include 5-6 years of daily observations of plankton taxa abundances and their morphological traits based on underwater imaging, water chemistry and physics, and size-fractionated plankton samples for DNA extraction and genomics work. 


This position allows a high level of independence, own ideas and contributions regarding scientific questions and themes covered, and the development of new research questions that complement the focus and expertise of the research group. We are interested in exploiting the rich information of our plankton datasets, that allows investigating the ecology of understudied plankton taxa (e.g. microzooplankton, mixotrophic phytoplankton), species interactions including facilitation, competition, grazing and host-parasite, modelling of morphological traits and taxa growth rates responses to environmental change, and eco-evolutionary dynamics. Modelling and forecasting community dynamics (including cyanobacterial blooms – www.cyanobloom.ch 
 ) is a priority area of our research group. The development of metagenomics for studying functional diversity and species interactions is a potential new research direction of interest. 


Our research group offers a diverse and multidisciplinary environment with local and international collaborations, state-of-the-art infrastructure, and expertise in community ecology of plankton, toxic cyanobacteria, data-analysis approaches, and machine learning, including access to high-performance computing resources. We embrace equity, diversity and inclusiveness by actively promoting equal opportunities for underrepresented minorities and supporting the compatibility of family and work. As persons and scientists, we value differences in ideas, background, belief, gender and opinion as the essence of creativity and as fundamentals to personal and professional growth. 


We are seeking a highly motivated, communicative, enthusiastic, and independent candidate with a passion for aquatic ecology. The ideal candidate is an open-minded, creative person who thinks outside the box and likes to question assumptions and norms. This position is hosted at Eawag in Dübendorf and the working language is English. 


Desired Qualifications: 
A recent Ph.D. in ecology, microbiology, environmental science, or related fields 
Conceptual understanding of ecological theory, community ecology, and biodiversity science 
Quantitative research experience in data analysis and/or bioinformatics, ecological modelling/forecasting, or ecosystem science 
Experience working with common programming environments, such as R or Phyton 
Experience in statistical analysis and/or machine learning 
Proficiency in processing large datasets and utilising high-performance computing 
Experience in publishing peer-reviewed journal articles 
Experience in working in interdisciplinary collaborative teams 
Excellent communication and writing skills in English 


Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis. All applications received by 30 November 2024 are guaranteed full consideration. Applications after this date will be considered until the position is filled. The application must include a cover letter explaining your motivation for the position (max 1 page) and your interests/ideas concerning the research that can be done in the hosting group (max 1 page), a CV, the contact information of at least 2 references, diplomas and transcripts. The start date will be defined by mutual agreement (early 2025) and the appointment is 24 months. 


Eawag is a modern employer and offers an excellent interdisciplinary working environment where staff can contribute their strengths, experience and ways of thinking. We promote gender equality and are committed to staff diversity and inclusion. The compatibility of career and family is of central importance to us.

Master Thesis, Internship

Internship or Master Thesis on ML-based optimization of LLM kernels for multiple platforms

Ref. 2024_024

Project description

Manually optimized kernels (e.g., flash attention) are critical for the performance of LLM inference and training. However, most of these kernels have typically been carefully optimized for a specific GPU platform and may pose a serious obstacle to the portability of LLM applications. Consequently, to achieve high-performance on different GPUs, LLM kernels need to be re-implemented or manually re-optimized.

Open AI Triton ( https://github.com/triton-lang/triton) 
 has recently emerged as a promising open-source alternative to writing custom CUDA kernels. It enables one to write kernels for execution on GPUs using simple Python code. Triton kernels can be both highly performant, as well as portable across different GPU architectures. For this reason, Triton is growing in popularity, and many LLM inference frameworks, e.g. vLLM ( https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) 
 , already include several kernels written in Triton.

Despite the promise of Triton being adaptable to many different GPU platforms, to do so still requires manual performance fine-tuning in practice. In this context, we aim to answer the following research questions:

Can ML-based performance models of Triton kernels predict their performance on different hardware with sufficiently high-accuracy? Can these performance models then recommend the best adaptation strategies?
How can we adapt existing Triton kernels to new platforms like NVIDIA’s Tensor Memory Accelerator? Potentially using established compiler-based optimizations?
Can we build an autonomous pipeline for fine-tuning Triton kernels for heterogeneous hardware?

Qualifications:

Enrolled or in possession of a Master's degree in computer science with a keen interest in data storage research, cloud computing and performance engineering.
Excellent coding skills: Familiarity with python, pytorch, or other ML frameworks.
Familiarity with Linux environments and software development tools (git/GitHub, IDEs, virtual machine and containers etc.).
High amount of creativity and outstanding problem-solving ability.

Preferred Qualifications:

Experience with CUDA or triton.
Experience with LLM inference applications.
Experience in machine learning.
Excellent oral and written English with good presentation skills.
Strong interpersonal skills and excellent written and verbal communication.

Diversity

Master Thesis, Internship

Internship or Master Thesis on What roles can modern NVMe storage play in accelerating LLM/RAG pipelines?

Ref. 2024_022

Project description

LLM/RAG pipelines have attracted a significant amount of community attention due to their wide-spread use, effectiveness, and potential applicability in a variety of domains. In an ideal case all data/metadata used in these workflows will be contained in memory. However, DRAM technology is facing challenges from multiple fronts as it is not scaling, has high cost ($/GB), and is energy inefficient. As the performance of NVMe devices approaches 10s of GB/s bandwidth, single digit microsecond IO latencies with millions of small IO operations/sec in a single machine, the key research question that we are interested in is : how can modern NVMe hardware/software stack help run data-intensive RAG pipelines (focus on RAG, i.e. information retrieval and LLM inference)?

In this context, we aim to answer the following research questions:

What dependencies do RAG pipelines have on storage and how is storage accessed in RAG pipelines? Are there specific access patterns, locality (temporal or spatial), or storage formats that make I/O generated by RAG workflows unique?
Vector DBs (VdB) play a critical role in a RAG pipeline. Can VdB benefit from using high-performance NVMe flash arrays that can support millions of small I/O operations per seconds? What are the best I/O strategies (scheduling, placement polling) over multiple NVMe devices.
With disaggregated storage, VdB can also be deployed in a distributed setting as a service. Here not only the storage, but also the networking performance comes into play. How efficiently does VdB-distributed use state-of-the-practice I/O hardware (networking and storage)

Qualifications:

Enrolled or in possession of a Master's degree in computer science with a keen interest in data storage research, cloud computing and performance engineering.
Excellent coding skills: Familiarity with Linux environments and software development tools (git/GitHub, IDEs, gcc, gdb, QEMU, virtual machine and containers etc.).
High amount of creativity and outstanding problem-solving ability.

Preferred Qualifications:

Experience with systems programming and internals (kernel, memory management, hardware, CPU)
Experience with data storage and NVMe storage internals and specification
Experience in machine learning or cloud
Experience with performance engineering tools (perf, fio, ebpf)
Excellent oral and written English with good presentation skills.
Strong interpersonal skills and excellent written and verbal communication.

Diversity

IBM is committed to diversity 
 at the workplace. With us you will find an open, multicultural environment. Excellent flexible working arrangements enable all genders to strike the desired balance between their professional development and their personal lives.

PhD Position in Decarbonizing the Future of the Chemical Industry

100%, Zurich, fixed-term




The Ecological Systems Design Group at ETH Zürich is an internationally leading research group in the field of modelling and improving the resource efficiency and environmental performance of products and processes from a systems perspective. We are inviting applications to fill a PhD position in ’Decarbonizing the Future of the Chemical Industry’.

Project background

This PhD position is contributing to several projects in the field of sustainable chemicals manufacturing. One of them may be the multi-year ’ NCCR Catalysis ’ project funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation. The goal of the project is to accelerate the urgently needed shift from a polluting fossil-based chemical industry to a more sustainable one.

Job description



The work will be carried out in an interdisciplinary team at the Ecological Systems Design Group. The primary objective of this doctoral project is to define and assess transition pathways for sustainable chemical supply chains on a global scale. The project aims to develop a comprehensive framework that integrates site-level data with industry-wide models to evaluate both current and future chemical production processes. Your work will involve setting up a database of global chemical production sites, focusing on production amounts, energy use, and regionalized environmental impacts. You will utilize existing high-quality data sources, commercial databases, and machine-learning-augmented life cycle assessment (LCA) tools to generate energy and mass balances for key production processes. A significant part of the project will be linking these production activities with regional energy supplies to trace the interconnected chemical supply chains, allowing for a detailed life cycle impact assessment.

You will be responsible for developing methods to quantify and evaluate the environmental impacts of novel chemical production pathways, focusing on the integration of alternative raw materials (e.g., biogenic sources) and innovative recycling approaches (e.g. chemical recycling). Additionally, your research will explore feedback loops between process advances (such as catalyst or solvent development) and the overall sustainability transition of the chemical industry. Throughout the project, you will collaborate closely with industry stakeholders and academic experts to validate your models and ensure the applicability of your findings. An integral part of your work is publishing your results in peer-reviewed journals and presenting them at international conferences.



Profile



Your qualifications should include:

A master level university degree in chemical engineering, process engineering, environmental engineering, environmental sciences, technical chemistry, computational chemistry or similar studies with excellent grades
Experience in modelling and programming; some prior skills in machine learning are beneficial
Knowledge and experience in the topics of life cycle assessment and chemicals manufacturing would be a benefit but are not required

Your employment will be contracted according to standard regulations at ETH (funding secured for 4 years). The project will start in January 2025 or upon mutual agreement. You are expected to contribute to the teaching and research activity up to a maximum of 20% of your working time.



Workplace



We offer

ETH Zurich is a family-friendly employer with excellent working conditions. You can look forward to an exciting working environment, cultural diversity and attractive offers and benefits.

Research Assistant (with possibility to obtain a PhD) (80%)

UniDistance Suisse, as an accredited university institute in accordance with the Swiss Higher Education Act (HEdA), has been offering bachelor’s and master’s degrees programs and continuing education and training programs in the faculties of Law, Psychology, Mathematics and Computer Science, Economics and History for over 30 years. These programs can be attended in parallel with family life, professional or sporting career, in a flexible distance learning model.

UniDistance Suisse is dedicated to the highest quality standards in teaching and research. With over 2300 students, it is the leading institution in the field of distance education in Switzerland. It has more than 450 employees, over 350 of whom are involved in teaching and research activities.

The recently approved SNF project, entitled “Numerical Methods for Efficient Acoustic Metamaterial Design” aims to design acoustic metamaterials which are used to manipulate sound waves, with the objective of, for instance, mitigating sound within the audible frequency spectrum. For the optimal design of such metamaterials our goal is to optimise models from (mixed) boundary/finite element discretisations. This leads to very rich structures in the underlying linear systems of equations. The aim of the project consists of fully exploiting these structures for efficient matrix storage as well as in the numerical solution techniques. These techniques will open up the possibility to apply parametric model reduction methods which are the basis for determining an optimal acoustic metamaterial. The project will be carried with our project partner Prof. Dr Steffen Marburg (Chair of Vibroacoustics of Vehicles and Machines, Technical University of Munich, Germany).

We are looking for a:

Research Assistant (with possibility to obtain a PhD) (80%)

Place of work: Brig. Remote work is possible, but regular presence (~2 days per week) in the office in Brig is expected.

PhD Candidate in Modeling Organic Carbon Sequestration in Marine Sediments

Position
Junior Researcher / PhD Position
100%, Zurich, fixed-term




The Environmental Physics Group at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETH Zurich) seeks a highly motivated Ph.D. student to investigate the global organic carbon budget in marine sediments and the effects of anthropogenic and climatic perturbations.

Project background



Marine sediments play a critical role in the global carbon cycle, serving as the ultimate sink for carbon by sequestering it in the form of organic carbon (OC) for geological timescales. However, the magnitude of OC buried in marine sediments remains uncertain, and its spatial distribution is still poorly understood.

This project aims to understand and quantify the global organic carbon budget in marine sediments and assess the influence of anthropogenic and climatic perturbations. It utilizes spatial machine learning models to determine the carbon budget which also serves to identify the environmental conditions that control the accumulation and remineralization of OC. The project focuses on how direct anthropogenic activities (such as river dams and coastal eutrophication) impact OC deposited in coastal marine sediments, and how climate change in Arctic environments has affected the accumulation of OC in Arctic sediments. Finally, it aims to predict future trends in the global carbon budget under the influence of climate change and anthropogenic perturbations.



Job description



As a successful candidate, you will compile and analyze organic carbon and its isotopic composition in specific sites. You will disentangle the environmental processes that drive the accumulation and remineralization of organic carbon in the Arctic using statistical methods. Additionally, you will quantify the contribution of different sources of organic carbon in Arctic sediments and assess how human activities, such as river damming and coastal eutrophication, are affecting organic carbon storage in coastal environments. Moreover, you will predict future changes in the sedimentary organic carbon budget due to intensifying climate change in the Arctic and expanding anthropogenic activities in coastal environments.

You will be working in the Environmental Physics Group, an interdisciplinary research group that focuses on studying the ocean, its physics, biogeochemistry, and ecology and their interactions with climate using different modelling techniques, led by Prof. Dr. Nicolas Gruber.

In addition, you will conduct a short research stay at the Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI) in Bremerhaven, Germany, with our collaborator, Dr. Gesine Mollenhauer, which will allow you to work with other researchers focused on understanding the carbon cycle in the Arctic.



Profile


A Master’s degree in a relevant field (e.g., oceanography, marine science, biogeochemistry, climate science, environmental science, or a related discipline).
A strong interest in laboratory analyses, modeling, and data analysis.
Excellent communication and collaboration skills, with the ability to effectively engage with diverse stakeholders and team members.
Demonstrated leadership qualities, including adaptability, problem-solving, and a proactive approach to challenges.
Ability to work in multidisciplinary teams, fostering an inclusive environment that values diverse perspectives and collaboration.
Strong interpersonal skills, with a focus on building and maintaining professional relationships.
Proficiency in a higher programming language (e.g., Matlab, Python).


Workplace






We offer


Training opportunities with leading experts in modelling, biogeochemical cycles, and ocean processes.
Support programmes and networking opportunities such as assisting at international conferences.
An interdisciplinary research group with different interests on processes occurring in the ocean.
A supportive working environment that values the well-being of the whole group.
Flexible working hours and possibility of working from home, promoting a healthy work-life balance.

Pensum:100%
Vertrag:Festanstellung
Arbeitsort:Newcastle Upon Tyne

Job Location

Newcastle Upon Tyne

Job Description

Do you aspire to be part of the innovation and technological advancement of a business behind brands like Gillette, Pampers, Head & Shoulders and Oral-B? Want to work for a company consistently recognised as one of the UK’s leading graduate employers?

Then apply for an industrial placement in Information Technology (IT) at P&G, where business, innovation and technology come together to create a competitive advantage.

IT underpins every area of our competitive advantage and every stage of the journey to develop, manufacture, market, and ship market-leading products. A career in IT at P&G will allow you to build experience across areas such as Application Development & Management, Marketing Technology, Data & Analytics, and IT Security & Risk. You will also build crucial business non-technical skills in leadership, communication, influencing and change management.

What To Expect:

During your industrial placement, you will get real responsibility from day one and be expected to dive straight in, take ownership of real projects and lead them to completion. You will see your projects deliver real business value and you will see growth in your own technical mastery, confidence, and communication and leadership skills. You will also receive first-hand experience of what a career in IT within a large corporate environment like P&G involves and find out if it is right for you.

Each intern receives a customized learning plan to ensure they get the right levels of coaching, mentoring and training as they deliver their work.

Previous IT internship projects have delivered: New chatbot capability for consumers; automatic camera recognition of safety breaches in manufacturing; machine learning to automate sales processes; project management of roll-out of EV chargers, and many more.

So, if you are looking for an exciting and challenging experience, have a passion for winning, strong leadership credentials and an interest in pursuing a career at P&G – this placement is for you!

Placements are available in our offices in Newcastle (Longbenton) and Weybridge (an easy commute from London with regular trains from Waterloo & Clapham Junction and a free shuttle bus from the station to the office). A limited number of placements may also be available in Manufacturing sites, typically our London Plant (West Thurrock, Essex).

What You Will Gain:

Responsibilities and Real Work from Day 1: You will be given specific projects and responsibilities working on real and live business challenges, just like a true P&Ger.

Continuous Training & Coaching: You will work with passionate people and receive both formal training and day-to-day mentoring from your manager. You will also have a Coach and a “Buddy” assigned to support you for the duration of the internship.

Competitive Compensation & Benefits: This is a paid internship; the monthly salary for this role is £2,333.33. On top of this, you’ll enjoy lots of benefits like the option to enrol in our double-matched pension, discounted P&G products, perks and flexible working arrangements. To find more information about our benefits package take a look here.

Full-time Role: Successful interns have the potential to secure a full-time position with P&G after graduation. As a 'build from within' company, our people start at entry level and progress through the organization. When we make a job offer, it’s with the expectation that you will grow into one of our future leaders, and to help you get there, you will work closely with skilled P&G veterans for mentoring and coaching at every step.

Job Qualifications

What We Look For:

University students graduating in 2027 with a placement year as part of their degree. We also welcome applications from students graduating in 2025 or 2026.

IT Interest - We welcome anyone aiming to start a career built around applying technology to business problems. Many of you will be Computer Science students, but we also welcome anyone with a STEM background and a genuine interest in technology.

Evidence of passion and achievements in academic and/or non-academic activities. Tell us what you’re proud of – be it playing a musical instrument or holding down a job alongside your studies. We want to get to know you during your application and encourage you to include examples that demonstrate our Peak Performance Behaviours including what actions you took and the results you achieved in your CV.

Strong verbal and written English language skills.

Right to Work:

For our placement roles, you will need to provide your own right to work in the UK for the full duration of your placement without requiring sponsorship from P&G. Note, this will require your right to work permission to be valid between 1st July 2025 to 12th June 2026 for a minimum of 37.5 per week.

P&G is legally required to ensure all candidates have the right to work in the UK from Day 1 of their employment. All applicants will therefore be asked to provide evidence of their right to work at the conclusion of the recruitment process as a condition of employment.

Start date:

This programme is designed as a year-long industrial placement running between 1st July 2025 until 12th June 2026 and we expect you to be available for the full duration. In exceptional circumstances, a delayed start date may be considered.

Application Deadline:

30th January 2025. Apply soon to secure your chance, as positions could be filled before the deadline. We may close early if all roles are filled.

At P&G #weseeequal

We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. At P&G we strive to build a culture where everyone feels welcome, included, and able to bring their full selves to work.

We champion social mobility and believe socio-economic status should not be a barrier to accessing job opportunities. That’s why in addition to this internship being paid, we offer provision of all the necessary technology and electronic equipment, access to a range of benefits, and financial support if you need to relocate for your internship - such as covering the cost of travel to your internship location.

We ensure that individuals with disabilities are provided reasonable accommodation to participate in the job application or interview process. Please click here if you require an accommodation during the application process. Please make sure to wait to hear back from us regarding your accommodation before proceeding with the online assessment, we thank you in advance for your patience.

Why Cisco

WeAreCisco. We are all unique, but collectively we bring our talents to work as a team, to develop innovative technology and power a more inclusive, digital future for everyone. How do we do it? Well, for starters – with people like you!

Nearly every internet connection around the world touches Cisco. We’re the Internet’s optimists. Our technology makes sure the data traveling at light speed across connections does so securely, yet it’s not what we make but what we make happen which marks us out. We’re helping those who work in the health service to connect with patients and each other; schools, colleges, and universities to teach in even the most challenging of times. We’re helping businesses of all shapes and sizes to connect with their employees and customers in new ways, providing people with access to the digital skills they need and connecting the most remote parts of the world – whether through 5G, or otherwise.

We tackle whatever challenges come our way. We have each other’s backs, we recognize our accomplishments, and we grow together. We celebrate and support one another – from big and small things in life to big career moments. And giving back is in our DNA (we get 10 days off each year to do just that).

We know that powering an inclusive future starts with us. Because without diversity and a dedication to equality, there is no moving forward. Our 30 Inclusive Communities, that bring people together around commonalities or passions, are leading the way. Together we’re committed to learning, listening, caring for our communities, whilst supporting the most vulnerable with a collective effort to make this world a better place either with technology, or through our actions.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us! #WeAreCisco

U.S. employees have access to quality medical, dental and vision insurance, a 401(k) plan with a Cisco matching contribution, short and long-term disability coverage, basic life insurance and numerous wellbeing offerings. Employees receive up to twelve paid holidays per calendar year, which includes one floating holiday, plus a day off for their birthday. Employees accrue up to 20 days of Paid Time Off (PTO) each year and have access to paid time away to deal with critical or emergency issues without tapping into their PTO. We offer additional paid time to volunteer and give back to the community. Employees are also able to purchase company stock through our Employee Stock Purchase Program.

Employees on sales plans earn performance-based incentive pay on top of their base salary, which is split between quota and non-quota components. For quota-based incentive pay, Cisco typically pays as follows:

.75% of incentive target for each 1% of revenue attainment up to 50% of quota;

1.5% of incentive target for each 1% of attainment between 50% and 75%;

1% of incentive target for each 1% of attainment between 75% and 100%; and once performance exceeds 100% attainment, incentive rates are at or above 1% for each 1% of attainment with no cap on incentive compensation.

For non-quota-based sales performance elements such as strategic sales objectives, Cisco may pay up to 125% of target. Cisco sales plans do not have a minimum threshold of performance for sales incentive compensation to be paid.
